# 2048-Game
This Java project is a digital version of the 2048 puzzle game.  It involves creating a 4x4 grid where number tiles slide and merge when a player swipes.  The goal is to create a 2048 tile.  The program handles the grid, tile movement, merging, and new tile generation, and determines when the game is over.
